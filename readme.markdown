# Discrete Event Simulation Framework

DESF is a simple library for discrete event simulation. It provides you with basic tools -
the simulation calendar (clock), queues, loggers, etc.

DESF is heavily event oriented, the best way to utilize it is to use pre-implemented observer pattern.
As events are the essence of dicrete simulation techniques, everything DESF try to take advantage of 
them to enable entity object to be cleaner and smaller.

The main aim is to provide enviroment in wich programmers can focus on the practical aspect
of tasks. As I have about a month or two to finish it, all proposals are welcome. Especially technical
advices, as I'm used to Ruby and PHP, so I'm having a hard time with C#.

Tlačipoznámka pro zasvěcené: Chacha, doprdele s Pascalem!
